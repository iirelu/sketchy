sketchy
=======

the code for most of my processing sketches

how to navigate
---------------

each sketch is a commit (cant be bothered making a new branch or file for each one) so just like go into the history and pick out the one you want

seeing the sketches in action
-----------------------------

you can see all these and a bit more [here](http://oannablue.tumblr.com/tagged/processing)

turning the code into gifs
--------------------------

in order to turn the code into gifs theres a few steps:

1. uncomment the `saveFrame("f##");` line and run the sketch
2. install imagemagick (its magic)
3. go to the sketch folder in a terminal or something and run `convert -delay 3 f*.png thegif.gif`
4. done. you hella done.

most of the code you see is actually [beesandbombs's](http://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/) which you can see [here](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7200880)
