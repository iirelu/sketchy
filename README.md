===================

the code for most of my processing sketches

how to navigate
---------------

each sketch is a commit (cant be bothered making a new branch or file for each one) so just like go into the history and pick out the one you want

seeing the sketches in action
-----------------------------

you can see all these and a bit more [here](http://oannablue.tumblr.com/tagged/processing)

copyright stuff
===============

most of the code you see is actually [beesandbombs's](http://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/) which you can see [here](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7200880)
